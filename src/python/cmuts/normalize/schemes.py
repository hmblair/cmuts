"""Normalization schemes for reactivity profiles.

A scheme defines only a *formula*: how to turn a pool of reactivity values into a
scale factor. The *granularity* of that pool is chosen separately, by the two
axes on :class:`~cmuts.internal.Opts` (``per_experiment``, ``per_reference``), so
any scheme composes with any granularity. Schemes are small classes registered in
a ``name -> instance`` table; both the CLI ``--norm`` choices and the dispatch
read from it, so adding a scheme is a single localized change (subclass
:class:`Scheme`, decorate with :func:`register`, implement :meth:`block_factor`).

Built-in schemes:
    raw     : no normalization
    ubr     : upper-bound reference -- 90th percentile of high-coverage positions
    outlier : 2-8% outlier-based normalization
    sm-dms  : ShapeMapper2-style per-nucleotide DMS normalization (per-base 75th
              percentile)

Granularity (one normalization factor is computed per "pool" of reference
profiles, then divided out):

    per_experiment=False : pool across all experiments (one shared factor keeps
                           experiments on a comparable scale)
    per_reference=False  : pool across all references (one factor for the pool)

So with neither axis set there is a single factor over everything; with both set
each (experiment, reference) is normalized independently (like rf-norm).
