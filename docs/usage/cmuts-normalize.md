## Usage

To run `cmuts normalize` requires an HDF5 file of modification counts generated by `cmuts core`. The basic syntax is
```bash
cmuts normalize \
  -o $OUTPUT \
  --mod $MOD \
  --nomod $NOMOD \
  $FILE
```
The `--mod` and `--nomod` flags specify the HDF5 datasets in which the treated and untreated modification counts are stored, respectively. The latter is optional.

!!! tip
    More than one file can be passed to `cmuts normalize`. In such a case, the modification counts are summed across the files before normalization. This is useful in the case where the inputs to `cmuts core` were split across multiple files.

## Command Line Options

### Core Options

**`-o, --output`** : Output HDF5 filename (required)

**`--mod`** : Name of the dataset containing treated modification counts (required)

**`--nomod`** : Name of the dataset containing untreated modification counts


### Output Control

**`--overwrite`** : Overwrite existing HDF5 file

**`--group`** : HDF5 group to place the output datasets in (none if not specified)


### Normalization Control

**`--raw`** : Do not normalize the reactivity values

**`--clip-low`** : Clip negative reactivity values

**`--clip-high`** : Clip reactivity values above 1

**`--blank-5p`** : NaN out this many bases on the 5' end (default: 0)

**`--blank-3p`** : NaN out this many bases on the 3' end (default: 0)

**`--blank-cutoff`** : NaN out any positions with less than this many reads (default: 10)

**`--norm-independent`** : Normalize each profile separately, rather than using experiment-wide statistics 


## Outputs

### Files

The output of `cmuts normalize` will be an HDF5 file with the following structure:

```
/
├── roi-mask
├── SNR
├── error
├── heatmap
├── norm
├── reactivity
└── reads
```

**roi-mask** (Region Of Interest): A boolean array indicating the region of the RNA which is of structural importance (i.e. all but the flanking sequences).

**SNR** (Signal-To-Noise): An estimate of the average SNR, based on the computed error, for each reference.

**error**: The standard error of the mean at each position.

**heatmap**: The prevalence of each mutation, insertion, and deletion type throughout the entire library.

**norm**: The normalization value used. It will be a scalar unless `--norm-independent` is passed, in which case each reference has its own norm value.

**reactivity**: The reactivity profiles.

**reads**: The number of reads used to compute each reactivity profile.

!!! warning
    If a value was passed to `--group`, then the above will be contained in an HDF5 group with that name.
